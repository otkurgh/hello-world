Just for practice

Hi This is a practicing a github.
new contents are added to the file.
Wow wowow woo 

here we go ...
I have added this contents to push it to branch and merge it master.
Changes for pull request. Mr. Narita said that elderly people should exercise mass seppuku to solve the problems of aging society in Japan.
Some people like Hiroyuki is trying to cover him saying what Narita was saying is metaphor and one must take the nuance of his comments from the context rather than individual terms/words.
